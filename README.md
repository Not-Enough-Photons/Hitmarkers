### Shoot and eliminate your foes with accurate feedback. Hitmarkers is a simple mod that adds visual/auditory feedback to any hit or kill you make, making for very satisfying combat!

# To Install:
Drag all files to the root BONELAB directory.

# To make custom textures
1. Create a hitmarker, finisher, and finisher feedback texture.

2. Make sure the texture is in powers of two! (i.e. 256, 512, 1024)*

3. Name the file accordingly. If it's a hitmarker, name it "marker.png." If it's a finisher, name it "finisher_marker.png." For the feedback skull, "finisher_feedback.png."

4. You're done!
